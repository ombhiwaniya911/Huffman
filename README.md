# Huffman Compression in Java

This project implements **Huffman Encoding and Decoding** using Java.  
It demonstrates how lossless data compression works by assigning variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequencies.

The project is structured as a **proper Java application** and can be executed easily using IntelliJ IDEA or the command line.
